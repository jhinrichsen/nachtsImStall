A monte  carlo simulation for the children's game "Nachts im Stall".
We've been trying and trying, but never managed to win.
According to this tiny simulation, changes are about 1/3 (29%).

The implementation is making heavy use of functional and ES 2015 features, namely

- Immutable data
- Lazy evalution
- map, reduce
- const, arrow functions

Look mom - no 'for' loops! And who did say that OO is the best for simulation?
